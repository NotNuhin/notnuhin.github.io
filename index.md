# HealthChat: Enhancing Health Conversations with AI and LLMs

![HealthChat](https://img.shields.io/badge/HealthChat-Open%20Source-blue)

Welcome to the HealthChat repository! Here, we focus on improving health conversations between humans and AI, particularly through large language models (LLMs). Our initial release, HealthChat-11K, includes valuable data for researchers interested in understanding user interactions in health-related discussions.

## Overview

HealthChat aims to bridge the gap between human health information-seeking behavior and AI capabilities. By providing a dataset and research paper, we encourage the exploration of real-world health conversations. This project will help advance understanding in healthcare dialogues, benefiting both researchers and practitioners.

## Getting Started

To get started with HealthChat, download the dataset and related resources from our [Releases section](https://github.com/NotNuhin/HealthChat/releases). Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and access the data.

## Data Description

HealthChat-11K contains a diverse set of health conversations. Each entry includes:

- User queries
- AI responses
- Contextual information

This dataset enables researchers to analyze conversation trajectories and user behavior in health-related dialogues.

## Key Features

- **Real-World Applications**: The dataset reflects actual health information-seeking behavior, making it relevant for practical applications.
- **Research Support**: Accompanying research papers provide insights into the data and methodologies used.

## Topics Covered

HealthChat touches on several important topics:

- **Conversation Trajectories**: Understanding how conversations evolve over time.
- **Conversations and Dialogues**: Analyzing the structure and flow of health discussions.
- **Health Information Seeking**: Investigating how users search for health-related information.
- **Healthcare**: Exploring interactions in various healthcare contexts.
- **Language Models**: Leveraging LLMs to enhance conversation quality.
- **Real-World Data**: Utilizing authentic user interactions for research.
- **User Behavior**: Studying how users engage with AI in health settings.
- **User Interaction**: Examining the dynamics of user-AI communication.

## Installation
